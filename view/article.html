                            <p>Although one of Samuel Eto'o's goals was to restore international visibility to the Cameroonian game, the president of Fecafoot, the national federation, could consider that his contract has been largely fulfilled. Since his election for four years on December 11, 2021, the former international and striker of the Indomitable Lions has not missed any opportunities to become the topic of conversation, and consequentially, the body he leads as well. </p>
                                  <p>"It was to be expected. Eto'o was one of the best players in the world. He played in big clubs [FC Barcelona, Inter Milan, Chelsea etc.], and he is a strong personality, very media-oriented. Everything he says and does takes on proportions that would not have been the same if Fecafoot had been presided over by someone else," said Claude Jabéa Bekombo, the coordinator of the Center for Research on Sport in Africa, in Yaoundé. Since he took office, the former striker has made a series of spectacular and increasingly contested decisions.

                                  <h2>Memorable dressing-down</h2>
                                  <p>The taxpayer will have to pay for another of Mr. Eto'o's decisions: the dismissal of the Portuguese coach Toni Conceiçao, following the last African Cup of Nations (CAN). Although supported by Narcisse Mouelle Kombi, the minister of sports – who has a poor relationship with Mr. Eto'o – the coach was replaced by the former Cameroonian international Rigobert Song. FIFA ruled in favor of Mr. Conceiçao, who had filed a complaint following his dismissal, by ordering Cameroon to pay him nearly 1.5 million euros in compensation.</p>
                                  <p>The Fecafoot president also dismissed Bill Tchato, another former Lion, without giving any reason. The national teams' coordinator had been the helpless witness of a memorable dressing-down that Mr. Eto'o had given the national team players following their victory against Burundi in June during the qualifiers for the CAN 2023, which will be played in the Ivory Coast in January 2024. The former international had considered their performance insufficient despite the result. The locker room incident had been opportunely filmed by a camera and quickly published on social networks.</p>

                                    "It shocked Cameroonians. The coach didn't say a word. It was surreal. That Eto'o yells at the players, OK, but he shouldn't broadcast the video! I, like others, think that Samuel appointed Song, who has a very poor coaching CV, to have a lot of control over selection, which Conceiçao would not have accepted," said a former player.
                                    
                                    Journalist Jean-Bruno Tagne, who was Mr. Eto'o's campaign manager before distancing himself from the new president, has nevertheless highlighted some successes. "Samuel knows football very well. He is an intelligent man, he has good ideas, and there were positive points in his first months at the head of Fecafoot." Mr. Conceiçao's replacement by Mr. Song in February was followed four weeks later by a World Cup qualification against Algeria (0-1, 2-1), a performance that will bring at least 8 million euros to the federation by virtue of the bonuses paid by FIFA to qualified teams.

                                <p>At a national level, the former FC Barcelona striker had committed to revitalizing domestic competitions. He succeeded in doing so, ensuring the smooth running of the championship and the Cameroon Cup. "He has always defended the players and ensured that their salaries are paid on time, and he does not hesitate to shake up the club leaders, who are not used to this," said Mr. Bekombo. This has made him even more popular with Cameroonian professional footballers, who once adored the player and now praise the manager.</p>
                                <h3>'Very personal' management</h3>
                                <p>"But although there is indeed some good in his record, I am generally disappointed," said Mr. Tagne. "The problem is that Fecafoot has given the impression of being managed in a very personal way, and without always having a guideline. His detractors have attacked him on this point in particular, pointing out that he has not attracted new big sponsors, as he said he would during his campaign. At this rate, you could wonder whethe he will last until the end of his term." </p>

Within the federation's executive committee, even though he has the majority of members, Samuel Eto'o is now facing rebellion from Guibai Gatama, the president of amateur club Mokola FC. He believes that the president of the federation is no longer legitimate to lead the body.

"In June, he was sentenced by the Spanish courts to 22 months in prison in a tax fraud case. However, article 36 of our statutes states that a candidate is ineligible from the moment he or she has been sentenced to a definitive sentence depriving them of their of liberty, with simple suspension or probation of more than six months. I'm therefore asking nothing more than the application of and compliance with the texts, and as such, the federation no longer has a legal president," said Mr. Gatama. But Mr. Eto'o, who has reached an agreement with the Spanish justice, will not go to prison.

However, Mr. Gatama has also blamed the federation boss for making appointments or dismissals "as he sees fit, not always in line with the statutes." A source close to the executive committee said "other members think like Gatama, but don't dare say so. In May, Benjamin Banlock, Fecafoot's secretary general, resigned, denouncing "management style."
